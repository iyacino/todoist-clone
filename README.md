# Getting Started with Create React App

In this project I created a clone of the popular Todoist application (https://todoist.com) from scratch using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & React Testing Library (unit & integration testing). In addition to the latter technologies, I used SCSS (CSS) and followed the BEM naming methodology.
